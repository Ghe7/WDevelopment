A short description  		
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the basic structure of sites,
</br> which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

<p>
CSS (Cascading style sheets) is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.
</p>
</br>
<p>
JavaScript (A logic based programming language) is used to control the behavior of different elements. HTML and CSS are not really programming languages but are necessary to understand to learn how JavaScript and other programming languages work.
