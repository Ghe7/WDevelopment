<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p> 
This website is dedicated for Coding 2 Lessons for NGGI BASE.
    Specifically intented for those who are interested to know what’s behind the website 
    and how to make a website not just on a website template. 
		We will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript to play and 
        understand how to create a website. 
		In this class, students are expected to create their own website by the end of the semester. 
        It’s  nice for students to share and encourage families and friends to visit
         students website when the time comes. This can also a good venue to students to post on 
         their school portfolio for easier access. 

A short description  		
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading style sheets) is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.
JavaScript (A logic based programming language) is used to control the behavior of different elements. HTML and CSS are not really programming languages but are necessary to understand to learn how JavaScript and other programming languages work./p>
